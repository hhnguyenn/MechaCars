MPG Regression
Ho = m=0
H1 = m is not 0

Which variables/coefficients provided non-random amt of variance to mpg values?
vehicle length: p=2.60e-12, reject null hypothesis, not random
vehicle clearance: p= 5.21e-08, reject null hypothesis, not random

From variables vehicle length, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD, only
vehicle length (p=2.6 x 10^-12) and vehicle clearance (p=5.21 x 10^-8) are statistically unlikely for random 
amounts of variance in the linear model.  Therefore, vehicle length and clearance are statistically significance.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?  Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model for vehicle weight, angle, and AWD are 0.  P-values prove to not be significantly 
different.  We are accepting null hypothesis for these variables and dependent values are most likely based on random chance.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?  Why or why not?
Being that intercept (p=5.08e-08) is also statistically significant,
there are other variables and factors that are contributing to variations that is not included in our model.

p value is significant, 5.35x10^-11, smaller than 0.05 significance level, so sufficent evidence to reject null hypothesis
r-squared = .71, 71% of all mpg predictions will be correct when using this linear model.




Suspension Coil Summary
Lot 1 and Lot 2 has an average PSI of 1500 with a variance of 1.00 and 7.47 respectively.  Lot 3 has an average PSI of 1496.14 
but with a variance of 170.29.  Being that the company specify that variance should not exceed 100 pounds per inch, 
Lot 3 does not pass the test.




Suspension Coil two-tailed One Sample T-Test
Ho = mu = 1500
H1 = mu is not 1500

alpha = 0.05
 
Lot 3
p-value = 0.04, smaller than 0.05 significance level, reject null hypothesis, Lot 3 mean is significantly different from population mean.

Lot 2
p-value = 0.61, greater than 0.05 significance level, do not reject null hypothesis, Lot 2 and population mean is not statistically significant.

Lot 1
p-value = 1.0, greater than 0.05 significance level, do not reject null hypothesis , Lot 1 and population mean is not statistically significant.

Lot 1 and Lot 2 is most likely by random with Lot 1 having almost 100% chance, data was by random.




Further Study
For most people, cars are just a mean of transportation so therefore, cost and fuel efficiency the most important.
So we should look at the correlation between cost of a car and fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) for various companies.  
Being that electric cars are the future, we can also compute this to how many miles a car can run per charge.
First, group our cars to different cost categories.
We can plot with ggplot's geom_boxplot, different vehicle's fuel efficiency by manufacturer, facet_wraping to various cost group to get a better view.

One-way ANOVA test should be used to compare average MPG for all groups of car companies based on cost.  Our null hypothesis would be the means of all groups are
equal.  Alternative hypothesis is at least one of the means is different from all other groups.  We can run an ANOVA test by comparing MPG based on cost within our 
own company and also run an ANOVA test on MPG based on cost for other companies in relation to ours.
